/*AutoIt
 * AutoIt is a freeware BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting.
 * It uses a combination of simulated keystrokes, mouse movement and window/control manipulation in order to automate
   tasks in a way not possible or reliable with other languages (e.g. VBScript and SendKeys).
 * AutoIt has been designed to be as small as possible and stand-alone with no external .dll files or registry entries 
   required making it safe to use on Servers. 
 * Scripts can be compiled into stand-alone executables with Aut2Exe.
 */
/*Uses of AutoIt

 * To handle elements like Windows Authentication box , File upload dialog box
